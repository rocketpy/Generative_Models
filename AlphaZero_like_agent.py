"""
Usage
Make sure you have Python >= 3.8 intalled. After that, run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary dependencies.

Then, to train an agent on one of the existing environments, run:

python3 tictactoe/two_dim/train.py
where tictactoe/two_dim is the name of the environment you want to train on.

Inside the train script, you can change parameters such as the number of episodes, the number of simulations and enable wandb logging.

Similarly, to evaluate the trained agent run:

python3 tictactoe/two_dim/eval.py
