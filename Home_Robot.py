# Workstation Instructions
"""
To set up your workstation, follow these instructions.
HomeRobot requires Python 3.9. These instructions assume that your system supports CUDA 11.7 or better for pytorch; earlier versions should be fine,
but may require some changes to the conda environment.

If on Ubuntu, ensure some basic packages are installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential zip unzip
Then clone home-robot locally:

git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot.git
cd ./home-robot
