# Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs


# https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla

"""
# About
Gorilla enables LLMs to use tools by invoking APIs. Given a natural language query, 
Gorilla comes up with the semantically- and syntactically- correct API to invoke.

# Features
With Gorilla, we are the first to demonstrate how to use LLMs to invoke 1,600+ 
(and growing) API calls accurately while reducing hallucination. 
This repository contains inference code for running Gorilla finetuned models, 
evaluation code for reproducing results from our paper, and APIBench - the largest collection of APIs, 
curated and easy to be trained on!

Since our initial release, we've served ~500k requests and witnessed incredible adoption by developers worldwide. 
The project has expanded to include tools, evaluations, leaderboard, 
end-to-end finetuning recipes, infrastructure components.
