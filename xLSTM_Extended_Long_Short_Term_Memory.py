# xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory

# https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm


# Features
"""
xLSTM is a new Recurrent Neural Network architecture based on ideas of the original LSTM. 
Through Exponential Gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques and 
a new Matrix Memory it overcomes the limitations of the original LSTM and shows promising performance 
on Language Modeling when compared to Transformers or State Space Models.
"""

# Installation
"""
Create a conda environment from the file environment_pt220cu121.yaml. 
Install the model code only (i.e. the module xlstm) as package:

Install via pip:

pip install xlstm
Clone from github:

git clone https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm.git
cd xlstm
pip install -e .
For using the 7B xLSTM model install mlstm_kernels via:

pip install mlstm_kernels
